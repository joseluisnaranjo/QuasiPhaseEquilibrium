# QuasiPhaseEquilibrium
This proyect aims  to improve the acuracy of thes prediction model developed by Xue Jian et al. where is presented a Neural Network model that predicts the quasi phase equilibrium of some alloys. Here in we improve the NN model in order to decrease the loss and improve the accuracy.
